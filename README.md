Here is my definition of _**Big Data**_.
> <span style="color: #1589F0">Big data is a strong thought or confident expression that now human can **measure** all kinds of information, which was not used or regarded as garbage due to its vagueness and disorder, and human can *create valuable knowledge* from the information.
